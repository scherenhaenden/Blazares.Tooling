# Blazares.tooling

This project is intended to convert all the generic functionalities I would need for anykind of project


## First things to consider
- I have too many pictures (More than 500K), but I got to be able to delete duplicates based of many different things. The most important key too me at this moment is the Hash value. I have many pictures that might look alike, but they are still different and maybe I am going to need them. 

- I need to store my pictures in a way that to me makes enough sense when I want to look for a picture based of dates.
